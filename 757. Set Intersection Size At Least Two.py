# You are given a 2D integer array intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represents all the integers from starti to endi inclusively.

# A containing set is an array nums where each interval from intervals has at least two integers in nums.

# For example, if intervals = [[1,3], [3,7], [8,9]], then [1,2,4,7,8,9] and [2,3,4,8,9] are containing sets.
# Return the minimum possible size of a containing set.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[3,7],[8,9]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: let nums = [2, 3, 4, 8, 9].
# It can be shown that there cannot be any containing array of size 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: let nums = [2, 3, 4].
# It can be shown that there cannot be any containing array of size 2.
# Example 3:

# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[4,5]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
# It can be shown that there cannot be any containing array of size 4.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= intervals.length <= 3000
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti < endi <= 108
